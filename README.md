# zx-c<br>
Boilerplate for ZX Spectrum C development using SDCC<br>
(Requires SDCC to be on the path.)<br>
<b>Note:</b> Do not use SDCC 4.0.0 due to issues with compilation. Use SDCC 4.0.7+
<br>
`zxmake.bat` will create a bootable `app.tap`<br>
Take note of the .bat file process. <br>
Should be an autoloading tape.<br>
